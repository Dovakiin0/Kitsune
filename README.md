# Notice!
Heya guys, thanks for your support. I had fun making this project, it was really good. But I think i'll be discontinuing the project soon, so i decided to open source the codebase of mobile application too (sadly without getting to complete my personal milestone). I will still be looking for some bug fixes and stuffs but doubt will ever get time to implement new features. So feel free to make use of this project and any new features/bug-fix related PR are always welcome.
Link to the [source code](https://github.com/Dovakiin0/animeworldz-react-native) of the mobile app.
